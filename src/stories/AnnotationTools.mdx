# Annotation Tools

The `allowedTools` parameter allows configuring which annotation tools are permitted.  
For example, you could let the user only annotate bounding boxes with the following:

<Source of={SiaStories.BBoxOnly} language="tsx" />

This will get you the following:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SiaStories.BBoxOnly} />
</Canvas>

## Control Junk

You can also restrict the user from using the junk functionality:

<Source of={SiaStories.NoJunk} language="tsx" />

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SiaStories.NoJunk} />
</Canvas>
